            <h3>jealousy, jealousy Olivia Rodrigo</h3>

            I kinda wanna throw my phone across the room <br>
            'Cause all I see are girls too good to be true <br>
            With paper-white teeth and perfect bodies <br>
            Wish I didn't care <br>

            I know their beauty's not my lack <br>
            But it feels like that weight is on my back <br>
            And I can't let it go <br>

            Com-comparison is killin' me slowly <br>
            I think I think too much <br>
            'Bout kids who don't know me <br>
            I'm so sick of myself <br>
            I'd rather be, rather be <br>
            Anyone, anyone else <br>
            My jealousy, jealousy started followin' me <br>
            Started followin' me <br>

            And I see everyone gettin' all the things I want <br>
            I'm happy for them, but then again, I'm not <br>
            Just cool vintage clothes and vacation photos <br>
            I can't stand it <br>
            Oh God, I sound crazy <br>

            Their win is not my loss <br>
            I know it's true, but <br>
            I can't help gettin' caught up in it all <br>

            Com-comparison is killin' me slowly <br>
            I think I think too much <br>
            'Bout kids who don't know me <br>
            I'm so sick of myself <br>
            Rather be, rather be <br>
            Anyone, anyone else <br>
            My jealousy, jealousy (yeah) <br>

            All your friends are so cool, you go out every night <br>
            In your daddy's nice car, yeah, you're livin' the life <br>
            Got a pretty face, a pretty boyfriend, too <br>
            I wanna be you so bad and I don't even know you <br>

            All I see is what I should be <br>
            Happier, prettier, jealousy, jealousy <br>
            All I see is what I should be <br>
            I'm losin' it, all I get's jealousy, jealousy <br>

            Com-comparison is killin' me slowly <br>
            I think I think too much <br>
            'Bout kids who don't know me <br>
            And I'm so sick of myself <br>
            Rather be, rather be (oh, oh) <br>
            Anyone, anyone else (anybody else) <br>
            Jealousy, jealousy <br>

            Oh, I'm so sick of myself <br>
            I'd rather be, rather be (oh, oh, oh) <br>
            Anyone, anyone else <br>
            Jealousy, jealousy started followin' me <br>
